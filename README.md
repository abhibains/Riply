# Riply
Riply is a backend  app that stores comments on blog posts. It has been made using Stitch which is serverless platform that makes it easy to build modern cross-platform app to build on top of MongoDB

## Getting Started ##
Rather than setting database on the local machine, I am going to create my database  on MongoDB Atlas, which is fully managed a global cloud databse.

## Steps to setup ##
1)Setup/Login to atlas

2)Setup a free cluster which might take few minutes

3)Create a new stitch application

4)Turn on anonymous authentication 

5)Setup of access rule on the created collection

6)Copy the generated chest request code snippet into your application file

All these steps help us include stitch SDK and setup up stitch app client which helps communicating with stitch back end. The stitch app client provides us functionality include methods for authentication, executing functions and accessing functions and accessing services.
